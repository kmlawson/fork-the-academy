# Forking the Academy: What We Can Learn About Collaboration from the Software Development World

Outline of the talk:

* Introductions
* Collaboration in History Scholarship
    * In three senses:
        * Working together in teams: projects, edited volumes
        * Working together on publications: articles, monographs, and textbooks
        * Working together across time


1. As researchers and teachers the open access movement has gotten a lot of inspiration from the open source world
2. But we still have not widely adopted some of its most powerful practices and tools: distributed versioning and direct collaborative production (at least for Historians), and the concept of "forking" or "branching" the products of our work so others can build directly on it.
3. Discuss the rise and the power of git and github in the software development world that is now used by over 3 million developers for over 5 million projects. Describe how the process forking code and collaborative development works.
4. Talk about the two major types obstacles in social sciences and humanities for adopting the use of git-like versioning:
	1. the disciplinary obstacles - our attachment to authorship, legitimacy, and control over our scholarship
        * economy of citations
        * fear of plagiarism
        * cult of originality
        * and the rabbit hole
	2. the technical obstacles - would require that we embrace the "return to text" as our primary working format, and learn some of the skills of versioning platforms such as github
5. Briefly introduce how it works for academic texts already.
