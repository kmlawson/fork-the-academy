# Forking the Academy: What We Can Learn About Collaboration from the Software Development World

Outline of the talk:

* Introductions
    * My background and motivations:
        * Open Source, and the Free Software movement
        * Digital Archive of Japan's 2011 Disasters - witnessing github at work
        *  
* Collaboration in History Scholarship
    * In four senses:
        * Working together in teams: projects, edited volumes, source materials
        * Working together in teaching
        * Working together on directly in writing: articles, monographs, and textbooks
            * Multi-Author Articles in last 15 years (1997-2012):
                * American Historical Review: 13
                * Past & Present: 21
                * Journal of Asian Studies: 24
                * In all these cases below 10% and in most cases two authors.
        * Collaboration across time: reusing and readapting our scholarship: citation, updated editions of textbooks

## Open Access and Open Source

* As researchers and teachers the open access movement has gotten a lot of inspiration from the open source world
* Discusison of "green" vs "gold" - emphasis is on access
* Discuss "gratis" vs "libre"
    * the backlash in the UK setting
    * CC-BY

## Coding Together

* Some of the practices and evolution of collaboration in the coding world
* The development of version control systems
    * Centralized vs.
    * Distributed
        * git

## Collaboration without Collaboration

* A flexible definition of collaboration - from the perspective of larger questions, or an organic community of scholars and scholarship
* In academic scholarship we still have not widely adopted some of its most powerful practices and tools: distributed versioning and direct collaborative production (at least for Historians), and the concept of "forking" or "branching" the products of our work so others can build directly on it.
* Discuss the rise and the power of github in the software development world that is now used by over 3 million developers for over 5 million projects. Describe how the process forking code and collaborative development works.

## GitHub, Forking & Pull Requests

* benefits of git
* lower the bar to entry and accessibility
    * introuction of simple client
    * clean web interface
    * rich visual interface for files and data on repositories
    * 

## Imagining Historical Scholarship and GitHub Approaches

* Assumes: libre open access - that is fully open source
* Scholarship of the past can be directly used and adapted 
	* if whole repositories are forked, they will know who is using their work
	* but always maintain their own copy
* While maintaining attribution: every word has its origin, can cherry-pick in materials, or fork whole repositories of text and data.
* Plagiarism won’t disappear, there will always be people who claim other people’s work as their own
* An alternative to quotations and footnotes for many tasks - since the author of any given sentence can potentially be revealed in the repository’s git index

* Talk about the two major types obstacles in social sciences and humanities for adopting the use of git-like versioning:

## Disciplinary Obstacles

	* the disciplinary obstacles - our attachment to authorship, legitimacy, and control over our scholarship
        * economy of citations
            * adds to entrenchment of practices
        * taboo of plagiarism
            * dissuades us from developing models for legitimate reuse
        * Distaste for Incompleteness
            * encourages a culture of secrecy
        * the danger of a "brick in the wall" approach
            * may lead to positivist resurgence
        * cult of originality
            * fails to acknowledge the variety of kids of creativity
        * and the rabbit hole of diffused authorship
            * creates anxiety and contributions will be drowned in the crowd
        * fear of transparency

## Technical Obstacles

	2. the technical obstacles - would require that we embrace the "return to text" as our primary working format, and learn some of the skills of versioning platforms such as github
