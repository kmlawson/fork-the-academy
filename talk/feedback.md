## 2013.4

* what about the importance of "voice" in what we create, isn't that lost?
* what about cases where I have collected material from oral interviews where the person trusts me to make good judgements about what I choose to use and how I used it
    * A: in these cases, the full raw data shouldn't be included in the repository but deposited somewhere with all the appropriate restrictions that accompany oral history works etc. Forking the academy shouldn't be for everything

## 2013.6

* what is the value added of this approach if the cost is so high?
    * A: potential to finish develop unfinished work, ability directly improve work that may have been poorly written but had a good idea or needed more data, the possibility of much larger scale collaboration and across gaps of time, and the ability to create living texts
* isn't this something with a much longer tradition
    * A: goes back to pre-citation days of just taking and stealing material for publication (age of mass plagiarism) - though this time attribution in deep in the system itself
* But there is so much resistance to even making work open access, let alone Libre access
* The economy of citations, counting and evaluating scholarship is so deep in our process of hiring and evaluating scholars.
