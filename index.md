Open Access vs. Open Source 
----------------------------

The two movements are connected, with the open access movement drawing upon experiences and energy of an open source movement that has a longer history.

### Open access

* Increasing support for open access
	* institutional repositories
	* green open access self-archiving
	* open access journals
	* more general culture of sharing online amongst academics
* In many ways this has drawn its inspiration from the open source movement
* However there are some significant differences 

### Open Source Culture of Sharing and Building

* generative enterprise
* based on the simple principle of openess and sharing
* but even more importantly collaborative enterprise
* does not and has never required that they work in the same physical space
* Blamed for fragmentation but despite this we see the products of open source
* Apache, Libre Office/Open Office, Ubuntu & Debian, Zotero, WebKit which runs Chrome, Safari, and soon Opera, Firefox and Mozilla

### Where They Differ

* the primary metaphor of our interaction is a dialogue. 
* even when there is collaborative writing, it is rooted in a time and a place, with a defined outcome. Except for the case of textbooks, rarely does our work come out in revised or updated editions
* Though we also employ the metaphor of "building upon" research "standing on the shoulders" of others and so on, it would never occur to us to simply pick up someone's essay or book and begin rewriting it.
* Part of this stems from the cultures of citation, attribution and the powerful taboos against plagiarism 

### Contrasting the Tools of Collaborative Writing

* What comes to many peoples' minds is the wiki, and with it a reference to the chaos and quality issues implied in a massive project such as wikipedia.
	* Wiki as a central (though it can be replicated as a whole if data is made available) location for content creation 
	* which includes versioning
	* usually only limited structures of control and maintenance by its administrators
* Tracking changes in a word processor document
	* Usually among a limited number of people working closely together on a text
	* Shallow versioning - usually changes are accepted and editing proceeds in waves
* Direct Collaborative Editing
	* Uses special software or online platforms for direct collaborative editing of a document (Google Docs, Etherpad, SubEthaEdit, etc.)
	* Ideal for rapid building of content, where versioning is less of a priority
	* Has a particular advantage in working well when two individuals are working on a document simultaneously
* Distributed Versioning Platforms
	* Git and Mercurial, with services such as Github allowing much easier interaction
	* Works best on raw text files (though they can incorporate any formatting markup)
	* Requires some adjustment to understand the process
	* Allows for collaboration on a repository of one or many files between many people. With services such as Github hosting repositories, it allows very easy submission of proposed improvements even from people who have no connection to a project, but, unlike a platform such as Wikipedia, for example, only some individuals are permitted to change the files of the repository and determined the fate of proposed changes, or "pull requests."
	* Distributed versioning platforms allow rich "branching" of different versions of a file or set of files and provides a workflow for reincorporating information from these different branches and any potential conflicting material
	* Perhaps most important, git hosts like Github make it extremely easy for anyone to "fork" a repository which they may then build upon, either submitting their recommended changes as "pull requests" to the original or as the start of a new direction of development.

### Authorship and Credit

The creation of a wiki page, a document produced through repeated exchange, and those which are the produce of direct simultaneous editing all handle the question of authorship and credit differently. In the case of a wiki production, the author of each edit can be traced in the history of the page. Every contributor works directly on the "master" product that is under control of the administrator of the wiki as a whole. Co-authorship in the case of an exchanged document or a simultaneously edited document is usually agreed upon by the group of individuals who created it together and made clear somewhere in the final product.

A repository on a hosted service like GitHub is created by a user or organization and all contributions accepted by this user and merged with the repository are saved in the version history of the document. However, the issues of authorship and credit do not end there. Anytime a repository is forked on GitHub, it remains a connection to its original, usually also acknowledged in the license or readme by the individual who "forked" it. Any work thus may exist simultaneously in hundreds or even thousands of forked versions, any of which may contain countless customizations, improvements, or new add

### TEMP: Quotes and Notes

"Generative Humanities, a mode of practice that depends on rapid cycles of prototyping and testing, a willingness to embrace productive failure, and the realization that any 'solution' generated within the Digital Humanities will spawn new 'problems'â€”and that is all to the good." - *Digital_Humanities*, 5

"Digital Humanities implies a reinterpretation of the humanities as a generative enterprise: one in which students and faculty alike are *making things* as they study and perform research, generating not just texts (in the form of analysis, commentary, narration, critique) but also images, interactions, cross-media corpora, softare, and platforms." -*Digital_Humanities*, 10

"Genetic editions, in which variants, versions, pentimenti, and amendments can be incorporated into a display or trail of evidence have been the dream of literary scholars since the rise of scientific philology in the 19th century. Tools for the realization of such complex forms of intellectual gamesmanship are changing and improving rapidly." -*Digital_Humanities*, 18

"One of the strongest attributes of the field of Digital Humanities is that the iterative VERSIONING of digital projects fosters experimentation, risk-taking, redefinition, and sometimes failure." -*Digital_Humanities*, 21

"Digital environments provide the ability to pull together many versions of a single work, tracking its development, noting its variants, and presenting the whole comparative array of witnesses."
