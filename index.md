Open Access vs. Open Source 
-------------------------

The two movements are connected, with the open access movement drawing upon experiences and energy of an open source movement that has a longer history.

### Open access

* Increasing support for open access
	* institutional repositories
	* green open access self-archiving
	* open access journals
	* more general culture of sharing online amongst academics
* In many ways this has drawn its inspiration from the open source movement
* However there are some significant differences 

### Open Source Culture of Sharing and Building

* generative enterprise
* based on the simple principle of openess and sharing
* but even more importantly collaborative enterprise
* does not and has never required that they work in the same physical space
* Blamed for fragmentation but despite this we see the products of open source
* Apache, Libre Office/Open Office, Ubuntu & Debian, Zotero, WebKit which runs Chrome, Safari, and soon Opera, Firefox and Mozilla

### Where They Differ

* the primary metaphor of our interaction is a dialogue. 
* even when there is collaborative writing, it is rooted in a time and a place, with a defined outcome. Except for the case of textbooks, rarely does our work come out in revised or updated editions
* Though we also employ the metaphor of "building upon" research "standing on the shoulders" of others and so on, it would never occur to us to simply pick up someone's essay or book and begin rewriting it.
 * Part of this stems from the cultures of citation, attribution and the powerful taboos against plagiarism 



"Generative Humanities, a mode of practice that depends on rapid cycles of prototyping and testing, a willingness to embrace productive failure, and the realization that any 'solution' generated within the Digital Humanities will spawn new 'problems'â€”and that is all to the good." - *Digital_Humanities*, 5

"Digital Humanities implies a reinterpretation of the humanities as a generative enterprise: one in which students and faculty alike are *making things* as they study and perform research, generating not just texts (in the form of analysis, commentary, narration, critique) but also images, interactions, cross-media corpora, softare, and platforms." -*Digital_Humanities*, 10

"Genetic editions, in which variants, versions, pentimenti, and amendments can be incorporated into a display or trail of evidence have been the dream of literary scholars since the rise of scientific philology in the 19th century. Tools for the realization of such complex forms of intellectual gamesmanship are changing and improving rapidly." -*Digital_Humanities*, 18

"One of the strongest attributes of the field of Digital Humanities is that the iterative VERSIONING of digital projects fosters experimentation, risk-taking, redefinition, and sometimes failure." -*Digital_Humanities*, 21

"Digital environments provide the ability to pull together many versions of a single work, tracking its development, noting its variants, and presenting the whole comparative array of witnesses."
